## Sublime Integration

Sublime has an excellent build system integration. You can leverage this with these two custom build policies.

## Installation

For invoking an interactive debugger from sublime via the build command add the the NodeD.sublime-build file to your user directory (on Mac OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User).

The NodeD.sublime-build does a noninteractive build (run) of your debug script.
