## Sublime Integration

Sublime has an excellent build system integration. You can leverage this with these two custom build policies.

These simple build files presume that node is on your path and executable from Sublime.

## Installation

For invoking an interactive debugger from sublime via the build command add the the NodeD.sublime-build file to your user directory (on Mac OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User).

The NodeD.sublime-build does a noninteractive build (run) of your debug script.
